# Welcome to NumbrGuessR

NumbrGuessR, I don't really need to elaborate.

ok fine..

Its a game about guessing a game. The user makes two input, by default 0 and 100. These values are the minimum and maximum values. The user then has to input the guess, and the code will tell whether its higher or lower.

The screenshot below is after the user has made a submit, so the user knows whether its too high or too low.
