This is simply a collection of small tasks that my teacher forced me to do. *i am currently crying, jk i love you andrás*

## What kind of tasks have you made?
Good question.

I've made [JSTask](https://github.com/rosessix/JSPratice/tree/main/jstask). JSTask is a piece of software to help junior developers pratice and become **the** best!

I've made [NumberGuessR](https://github.com/rosessix/JSPratice/tree/main/numberguesser). This game is for the funz and is entirely made in 30 minutes and is about guessing a number between a min and max value.
